# Day 31 (22nd September):
    I started working on the third tasks for the internship which is creating a system for conferences management as a mobile application.
    
    The project consists of two main parts:
        1- The application itself which has multiple views for showing the details of the conferences, viewing authors list and to veiw session papers based on chosen keywords. For this part I decided on using Dart language with Flutter framwork as it is versatile and easy to develope with.
        2- The second part of the project is the web application for administrative purposes which I decided on using firebase services for this purpose. As both tools are created by google, flutter integrates well with firebase giving an easy and fast web experience and no need for backend when using firebase.

    The first thing I did was analyszing the project requirements. After understaing the task I started on designing the wireframe for the application using Figma.
        Then I started on creating the ERP UML diagram for the relational database for the application but I didn't finish.

# Day 32 (23rd September):
        I continued woriking on the ER Diagram and finished it. Then I sent the wireframe and ERD to the professor by email asking for his feedback.

# Day 33 (24th September): 
    I installed a 3rd-party emulator program called (LDPlayer) so I can using with VS Code for app simulation, which is faster and lighter than using other emulators like Android Studio Emulator. 
    
    I created a demo project to test the new emulator and it worked well.

    I started setting up the firebase and connecting it to the project files.

    I sent an email to the profesor with the wireframe and ERD odf files attached to it asking for his feedback and notes.

# Day 34 (25th September): 
    I updated the wireframe according to The professor's feedback.
    I continued setting up the firebase


# Day 35 (26th September): 
    I updated the wireframe furthurmore according to The professor's furthur feedback.
    I updated the ER Diagram according to The professor's  feedback by adding order feilds to multiple entities and creating a new Affiliations Table with many-to-many relationship with Author Table.
