# Day 31 (22nd September):
    I started working on the third tasks for the internship which is creating a system for conferences management as a mobile application.
        The project consists of two main parts: the application itself which has multiple views for showing the details of the conferences, viewing authors list and to veiw session papers based on chosen keywords. For this part I decided on using Dart language with Flutter framwork as it is versatile and easy to develope with. The second part of the project is the web application for administrative purposes which I decided on using firebase services for this purpose. As both tools are created by google, flutter integrates well with firebase giving an easy and fast web experience and no need for backend when using firebase.
    The first thing I did was analyszing the project requirements. After understaing the task I started on designing the wireframe for the application using Figma.
        Then I started on creating the ERP UML diagram for the relational database for the application but I didn't finish.

# Day 32 (23rd September):
    I continued woriking on the ER Diagram and finished it. Then I sent the wireframe and ERD to the professor by email asking for his feedback.
