    Task: Setting Up Firestore Stream for Real-Time Data Updates

    Description: Today, I worked on integrating Firestore streams into the Flutter application to enable real-time data updates for the conferences collection. This functionality ensures that whenever a new document is added or an existing document is modified, the app can dynamically reflect these changes in the UI.

    Steps Taken:
        Data Cleanup:
        --Removed existing user records from Firebase Authentication, retaining only one user to ensure a clean slate for testing.

        Setting Up Firestore Stream:
        --Implemented a stream in the DatabaseService class that listens for changes in the conferences collection.
        --Configured the .snapshots() method to return a QuerySnapshot whenever the data in Firestore changes enabling real-time updates.

    Integrating Firestore Stream with Provider:
        --Wrapped the home screen in a StreamProvider to listen to the Firestore stream and provide data to descendant widgets.
        --Linked the Firestore stream to the home screenâ€™s StreamProvider, making data accessible throughout the widget tree.

    Creating the Conference List Widget:
        --Developed a ConferenceList widget that cycles through and displays each document from the conferences collection.
        --Printed out the document data in the console for verification, ensuring that the stream returns the expected values.
    
    Testing and Debugging:
        --Registered a new user and verified that a corresponding document is created and updated dynamically in Firestore.
        --Debugged issues related to null values and missing document fields to ensure smooth data retrieval and display.

# Day 43 (8th October): 
    
    Task: Creating and Integrating Conference Model for Firestore Data

    Description: Today, I focused on refining how Firestore data is handled in the Flutter application. The goal was to convert Firestore query snapshots into a list of Conference objects, making it easier to manage and display data in the UI. This process involved creating a Conference model class and mapping Firestore snapshots to this custom model.

    Steps Taken:

        -Creating the Conference Model Class.
        -Mapping Firestore Query Snapshots to Conference Objects.
        -Updating the Firestore Stream.
        -Refactoring Conference List Widget.

# Day 44 (9th October): 

    Task: Displaying Conference Data in the Application using ListView

    Description: Today, I focused on rendering the Conference data obtained from Firestore into the UI of the Flutter application. This was accomplished by utilizing a ListView.builder widget to iterate through a list of Conference objects and displaying each entry in a customized tile format.

    Steps Taken:
        -Implementing ListView Builder:
            --Replaced the static container with a ListView.builder widget to dynamically render a list of Conference objects.
            --Configured the ListView.builder with the appropriate item count (conferences.length) and an item builder function to construct each list item based on its index.

        -Creating the ConferencesTile Widget:
            --Developed a custom widget named ConferencesTile to display the conference properties (name, location, start and end dates).

        -The ConferencesTile widget includes:
            --CircleAvatar: For Displaying a picture regarding the conference.
            --Title Text: Displays the name of the conference.
            --Subtitle Text: Displays location of the conference.
            --This structure allows each ConferencesTile to visually represent a single Conference object in the list.

        -Connecting the ConferencesTile to the Conference List:
            --The ConferencesTile widget was integrated into the ConferencesList widget, where each item in the list is passed as a Conference object to ConferencesTile.
            --This ensures each ConferencesTile is populated with the correct data from Firestore, providing a neat display of the conference preferences.

# Day 45 (10th October): 
    Task:
        -Implement a list of days for each conference in the app.
        -Ensure that clicking a conference tile opens the DaysScreen to display the days of that conference.
        -Resolve the "Null check operator used on a null value" error.

    Actions Taken:
        -Created DaysScreen:
        
        -Updated DaysList Widget:
        
        -Debugged "Null Check" Error:
        
        -Verified Navigation and Data Flow:
        
    Outcome:
        -Successfully implemented the feature to display days for each conference.
        -Resolved the "Null check operator used on a null value" error by handling null data more gracefully.
