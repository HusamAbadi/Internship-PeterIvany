# Day 37 (30th September):
    I completed the firebase setup and now it's ready to be used.
    I brainstormed the structure of the program in which I know how to devide each portion of it. and it goes as follows:
        The app is structured with a root widget MyApp, which has a Wrapper widget beneath it. The Wrapper listens for user authentication changes. Based on the authentication status, it dynamically displays either a home screen (for logged-in users) or an authentication screen (for logged-out users). The home screen lists user data and preferences, while the authentication screen allows switching between sign-in and registration widgets. The Wrapper serves as the central point for managing which screen to display.
